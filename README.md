Predict the price of cars

## Problem
Used car valuation is easy for professional dealers, but deciding whether a price is fair or not presents a major problem for most buyers looking to buy a car e.g. at an online marketplace.
In order improve the experience users have on mobile.de, we aim to display a "mobile.de market price" on any listing page for a used car. To achive this, an automatic valuation of used cars needs to be set up.
You have data from the mobile.de listing data base. It contains data from each listing as well as data about the car to be sold. There are two data sets, test & train.


Please predict the prices in the test set. Include an easily interpretable evaluation of the quality of your model (imagine you need to explain this to a product manager), this could be e.g. a plot of predicted vs. observed prices, but also anything else that seems suitable to you.
How good is the model? Would you use it on the website? Why (not)? Is there anything else you noticed?
